## Use Case
    1) A Use Case is all about a What. It does not care about a How.
    2) steps a system takes to make something happen.
    3) A Single Use Case represents a single task or goal.

## A Use Case contains 3 parts
    1) Clear Value to the System
        A Use Case helps to achieve a goal.
    2) Start & Stop 
        A Use Case has a definite starting & stopping point.
    3) External Initiator
        A User or another system starts or initiates a use case.
